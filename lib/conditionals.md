# What is a conditional?

A condtional in ruby is a sort of rail switch inside a chunk of ruby code. Based on the information available condtionals cause the program to take one of multiple predetirmined routes 
determined by the user.  If, else, and elsif are the tools used to acomplish this.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

The == is a comparison tool that checks whether the values on both sides of it are equal in a true or false, yes or no binary.
The = is an assignment tool that makes applies the value of the left side operand(s) to the right side operand. (yes I did have to google what operand meant.)
